***3D models for 2D sprite items!***

## **❔ About**

teyokuma's 3D Item Models is a resource pack for Minecraft: Java Edition. It is intended to add 3D models to 2D sprite items and to make items with all unique models consistent. Models and textures are not added or changed and can be used in conjunction with other resource packs. It also supports multiple mods.

## **📸 Example**

Here is an example of how the item model is changed.
